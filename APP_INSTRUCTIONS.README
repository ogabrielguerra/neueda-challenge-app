*** ENV / DOCKER
This app relies on Docker, so youÂ´re going to find two related DOcker files in the root dir: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml.
These files are responsible for the container's configuration and can be used to add more features or tie other useful technologies as well.

    ** Files
    Please, note that the App related files are mounted in external volumes, preventing Docker to delete project's data.

    ** Serving
    For this stack we're going to user Apache + PHP7 + MySQL5.

    ** DB
    When the container is going up, Docker will make a data dump with the necessary tables and data.
    The .sql script is in /dump. MySQL files are located in .db_data. There's no need to touch it.

    ** Get Running!
    To get the App/Container running just get into the terminal, type "docker-compose up -d" and hit enter.


*** BACKEND
The project's structure is very simple. You have a front-controller (index.php) which loads the file "bootstrap.php".
These file is responsible for loading necessary Classes using PHP Autoloader function.

    ** Extending  / Adding new Classes
    If you need to extend features creating new Classes feel free to do so.
    Just remember to place your Classes in /backend/classes dir.
    Also the file must follow the patter [ClassName.Class.php] otherwise your Class won't load and the App will crash!


*** FRONTEND
The frontend uses HTML, CSS and JS. Since it's a simple App jQuery suits it well. Other dependencies are Bootstrap anf Fontawesome.
All the assets, including images are located in /assets.
